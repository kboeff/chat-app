# Homework

Here are some ideas to improve the application:

    + Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects.
    + Add support for nicknames.
    Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it. Instead append the message directly as soon as he/she presses enter.
    Add “{user} is typing” functionality.
    Show who’s online.
    Add private messaging.
    Share your improvements!
